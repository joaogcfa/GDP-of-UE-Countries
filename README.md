# GDP Analysis of Countries in the UE

This project is aimed to analyse the thesis "Countries in the UE have their GDP greater than countries that are not in the Union". \n
The main file is the jupyeter notebook "GDP Analysis of Countries in the UE.ipynb" which covers the data used and the full analysis of it.
It is important to add that this was my first data science project in my university and in my life.
